<h2> Listing repositories, star count and used languages of a GitHub user </h2>

<p> Below, provide the username you want to check and determine if you want to see the most used languages. <br>
    Listing the languages takes significantly more time than just listing repositories. <br>
    Depending on the number of repositories that the selected username has, this can take from several seconds up to several minutes. <br>
    <br>
    Please also note, that there is an hourly limit imposed by GitHub on the API access. <br>
    After the limit is reached, only a list of used languages will be printed without specifying their usage in bytes. <br>
    Also, the entire search will become slower then.
